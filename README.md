## Overview

![screenshot](/assets/img/interior-design.gif)

The landing-page of interior design was made with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The responsive page was built with grid and flexbox. 
I have learned how to hide and show mobile menu using basic of JavaScript manipulating DOM and how to use grid to overlap elements in CSS.
